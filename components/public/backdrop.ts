// Its own file so it can be tested without dragging React and the Square SDK
// loader into a DOM test - this one judgement has now shipped the wrong answer
// in both directions (light fields on a dark checkout, then dark fields on a
// light one), so it is worth pinning down on its own.
//
// NOT the data-theme attribute: a site whose brand palette is dark paints a
// dark checkout while data-theme still says "light", and the question that
// decides the palette is what colour actually surrounds the fields. So: walk up
// from the container to the first element whose opaque background is the colour
// actually on screen, and measure that. The attribute is only the tie-breaker
// when nothing qualifying is found.

    // This is the whole bug, not a hypothetical: the site's <body> carries the
    // owner's Theme colour as its background-color - the tint the browser puts
    // in its own UI, which is very often a deep brand shade on an otherwise
    // white site - and paints a flat gradient of the real page colour over the
    // top. Measuring it turned every checkout on a dark-tinted site into a dark
    // card panel in broad daylight. Walking past it lands on the root element,
    // which carries the page colour itself and nothing else.
